A very basic profiler for Python code.

The code is located in `profiler/profiler.py`. Example usage is in the docstring of `Profiler`
and in the `example/example.py` along with `main.py`.

For Python 3, use the code from the `python3` directory. Tested with Python 3.9.10.

## Python 2.7

To work with Python 2.7, use the version from the `python2` directory. Tested with Python 2.7.18.
